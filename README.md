Multi-Scale Temporal Frequency Attention Network (MTFNet) innovatively integrates Multi-Scale time-frequency domain attention into the Video Swin Transformer. Through Multi-Scale TemporalFrequency Attention Module (MTFAM), MTFNet learns the most important regions in eye movement images, enabling it to capture features more effectively from sequential data and gain a deeper understanding of the structure within eye movement images.
